        "**Can you explain how WLLN can be derived?**\n",
        "\n",
        "To derive the WLLN, we can first calculate the expected value and variance of the sample average. The expected value of the sample average is the same as the population's expected value, while the variance decreases as the sample size grows. This shrinking variance means that the sample average is less likely to deviate from the true average as more data is collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Chebyshevâ€™s inequality, we can bound the probability that the sample average deviates from the true average by more than a certain amount. We see that as the sample size increases, the upper bound for this probability approaches zero. This guarantees that, with a large enough sample, the sample average will be very close to the true average, which is the WLLN.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Can you describe what is IID samples? What is a sample mean?**\n",
        "\n",
        "IID samples are independent and identically distributed random variables, meaning each sample is drawn from the same distribution and doesn't depend on the others. The sample mean is the average of these observations and serves as an estimate of the population mean. As the number of IID samples increases, the sample mean converges toward the true population mean, which is the WLLN.\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "**Can you describe the inequalities that we used to prove WLLN?**\n",
        "\n",
        "To prove the Weak Law of Large Numbers, we used the Chebyshev's inequality. Markov's inequality provides an upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is above a certain threshold. Chebyshev's inequality is an upper bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by more than a certain amount, based on its variance. This inequality helps show that as the sample size increases, the probability of large deviations from the expected value decreases, proving the WLLN.\n",

        "\\\\\n",
        "\n",
        "**Can you explain why we say we can estimate probability using simulation because of WLLN? How is probability related to expected value?**\n",
        "\n",
        "We can estimate probabilities using simulation because of the Weak Law of Large Numbers, which states that as we collect more samples, the average of those samples converges to the expected value. Since probabilities can be viewed as expected values of indicator random variables, simulating experiments allows us to approximate these probabilities by taking averages of observed outcomes. As the number of simulations increases, our estimates become more accurate, reflecting the true probabilities of events in the underlying distribution.\n",

        "  - $I = 0$ if the coin lands on tails\n",
        "\n",
        "This function indicates the occurrence of the event by returning 1 for heads and 0 for tails. The average of this indicator over many flips gives the probability of landing heads, i.e. the true expected value/probability of the event occurring."
