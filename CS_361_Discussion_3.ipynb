        "1. Professor Hongye has a list of 55 different songs and she wants to  divide them into 5 groups to play on each of the week days, how many ways are there for the division? It's possible one day doesn't have any song. Songs will not be repeated. It won't allow the case of \"no songs for 2 days or even more days\".\n",
        "\n",
        "We can break this problem down into small steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Find the number of ways to divide up the 55 songs among the 5 days without any restrictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calculate the number of ways where exactly 2 days are without any songs, 3 days are without any songs, and 4 days are without any songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Add the values from #2 up and then subtract them from the value from #1\n",
        "\n",
        "For finding the number of ways to divide up the 55 songs among the 5 days without any restrictions, we can use the stars and bars approach to derive this value. Basically, because there are 5 days we want to split the songs into, there are $5 - 1 = 4$ divisions/bars that can be rearranged in our dataset. These 4 divisions must be placed in between 55 songs, so therefore there are $55 + 4 = 59$ slots to choose from to place the 4 divisions. Therefore, the total number of ways to divide up 55 songs between 5 days is ${59 \\choose 4} = 204297$ ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we must calculate the number of ways where exactly 2 days are without any songs, 3 days are without any songs, and 4 days are without any songs. Let's start with calculating exactly 2 days: we know that having exactly 2 days without songs is the same as distributing all the songs among 3 days, which means we'd have 2 divisions for 57 slots. Therefore, there are ${57 \\choose 2} = 1596$ ways. Now we must calculate how many ways there are to have two days empty out of 5 total days, and multiply this with the number calculated above: ${5 \\choose 2} \\cdot 1596 = 15960$ total ways where exactly 2 days are without any songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we must calculate the number of ways where exactly 3 days are without any songs. We know that having exactly 3 days without songs is the same as distributing all the songs among 2 days, which means we'd have 1 divisions for 56 slots. Therefore, there are ${56 \\choose 1} = 56$ ways. Now we must calculate how many ways there are to have three days empty out of 5 total days, and multiply this with the number calculated above: ${5 \\choose 3} \\cdot 56 = 560$ total ways where exactly 3 days are without any songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we must calculate the number of ways where exactly 4 days are without any songs. We know that having exactly 4 days without songs is the same as distributing all the songs among 1 day, and there is only 1 way for doing this. Now we must calculate how many ways there are to have four days empty out of 5 total days, and multiply this with the number calculated above: ${5 \\choose 4} \\cdot 1 = 5$ total ways where exactly 4 days are without any songs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that we have calculated all the values from the small steps, we can subtract all of them from the total number of ways we calculated first: $204297 - (15960 + 560 + 5) = 187772$ ways"

        "2. Three students of CS361 play a game of summing up the random numbers they get. The first student takes a random card from 10 cards that has a number from 1 to 10 respectively. The 2nd student rolls a wheel that have numbered & evenly distributed slots, the numbers are from 1 to 6. The 3rd student takes a number from a 4-sided fair die with numbers from 1-4 respectively. What is the probability that the sum's last digit is 3, or 6, or 1?\n",

        "For this problem, we can calculate the probability by calculating the cardinalities of the event space and the sample space, and then dividing those values. The cardinality of the sample space is a simple calculation: there are 10 choices for the first student, there are 6 choices for the second student, and there are 4 choices for the third student, so the total number of combinations is $10 * 6 * 4 = 240$.\n",

If a 1 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 2, 5, or 0, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $1 + 4 + 1 = 6$ ways. If a 2 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 1, 4, or 9, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $0 + 3 + 2 = 5$ ways. If a 3 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 0, 3, or 8, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $1 + 2 + 3 = 6$ ways. If a 4 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 9, 2, or 7, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $2 + 1 + 4 = 7$ ways. If a 5 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 8, 1, or 6, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $3 + 0 + 4 = 7$ ways. If a 6 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 7, 0, or 5, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $4 + 1 + 4 = 9$ ways. If a 7 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 6, 9, or 4, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $4 + 2 + 3 = 9$ ways. If a 8 is rolled, then the sum of the next two rolls must end in 5, 8, or 3, so the number of possible ways this can happen is $4 + 3 + 2 = 9$ ways.
